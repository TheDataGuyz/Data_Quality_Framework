# Data Quality Automation Framework Documentation

## 1. Introduction

The Data Quality Automation Framework is designed to ensure the quality and integrity of data within our organization's databases. It provides a systematic approach to defining, executing, and monitoring data quality rules across various data sources.

## 2. Components

### 2.1. DQ_RULE Table

The `DQ_RULE` table stores metadata about data quality rules defined within the framework. It includes information such as the rule category, severity, description, validation script, and timestamps for creation and updates.

### 2.2. DQ_RESULT Table

The `DQ_RESULT` table records the results of data quality checks performed by the framework. It captures metrics such as the count of passed and failed checks, percentage of failed checks, and audit timestamps.

### 2.3. DQ_ERROR Table

The `DQ_ERROR` table logs errors encountered during data quality checks. It provides details such as the affected rule, job, audit, subject area, database, schema, table, column, column value, primary key value pair, result, severity, description, audit timestamp, and PII flag.

## 3. Workflow

1. **Rule Definition**: Data quality rules are defined and stored in the `DQ_RULE` table. Each rule specifies criteria for validating data integrity.

2. **Rule Execution**: The framework executes data quality rules against specified data sources.

3. **Result Logging**: Results of rule execution are logged in the `DQ_RESULT` table, including metrics such as pass/fail counts and timestamps.

4. **Error Handling**: Any errors encountered during rule execution are logged in the `DQ_ERROR` table for further investigation.

## 4. Usage

### 4.1. Defining Data Quality Rules

- Use the `DQ_RULE` table to define data quality rules.
- Populate relevant columns such as `SUBJECT_AREA`, `DATABASE_NAME`, `SCHEMA_NAME`, `TABLE_NAME`, `COLUMN_NAME`, `PRIMARY_KEY_COLUMN`, `RULE_CATEGORY`, `RULE_THRESHOLD`, `RULE_SEVERITY`, `RULE_DESCRIPTION`, and `RULE_VALIDATION_SCRIPT`.
- Ensure accurate and descriptive documentation for each rule.

### 4.2. Executing Data Quality Checks

- Implement processes to trigger the execution of data quality checks against specified data sources.
- Monitor the execution of checks and review results logged in the `DQ_RESULT` table.

### 4.3. Handling Errors

- Monitor the `DQ_ERROR` table for any errors encountered during data quality checks.
- Investigate and resolve errors promptly to maintain data integrity.

## 5. Maintenance

- Regularly review and update data quality rules based on evolving data requirements and business needs.
- Monitor and optimize the performance of data quality checks to ensure timely execution.
- Periodically review and clean up historical data in the `DQ_RESULT` and `DQ_ERROR` tables to manage storage resources.

## 6. Conclusion

The Data Quality Automation Framework plays a critical role in maintaining the quality and integrity of our organization's data. By defining, executing, and monitoring data quality rules, we ensure that our data remains accurate, consistent, and reliable for decision-making processes.
