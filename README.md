# Data_Quality_Framework
Creating a data quality assessment framework document involves defining the structure, rules, and processes for evaluating the quality of data within an organization. Below is a template for such a document, including tables for rules, results, and error logs, as well as a description of a dashboard for presenting the data quality assessment findings.

### Data Quality Assessment Framework Document

#### 1. Introduction
Provide an overview of the purpose and scope of the data quality assessment framework.

#### 2. Objectives
Define the objectives of the data quality assessment framework, including what aspects of data quality it aims to evaluate and improve.

#### 3. Components of the Framework

##### 3.1. Rule Table
Define the rules or criteria used to assess data quality. These rules should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

| Rule ID | Rule Description                                    |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| R001    | Data completeness: Ensure all required fields are populated. |
| R002    | Data accuracy: Verify data accuracy against trusted sources. |
| R003    | Data consistency: Check for consistency across different datasets. |
| R004    | Data timeliness: Assess data timeliness based on expected update frequency. |

##### 3.2. Result Table
Document the results of the data quality assessment, including the evaluation of each rule.

| Rule ID | Dataset Name | Result |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| R001    | Sales Data   | Passed |
| R002    | Customer Data| Failed |
| R003    | Inventory Data| Passed |
| R004    | Website Traffic Data| Passed |

##### 3.3. Error Log Table
Record any errors or issues encountered during the data quality assessment.

| Error ID | Dataset Name | Error Description | Resolution |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|------------|
| E001     | Customer Data| Missing values in 'Email' field | Update script to handle missing values |
| E002     | Sales Data   | Inconsistent date format | Standardize date format |

#### 4. Data Quality Dashboard
Design a dashboard to visualize the data quality assessment results and trends. Include graphs, charts, and summary statistics to provide stakeholders with actionable insights into data quality.

The dashboard should include:

- Overall data quality score
- Trends over time (e.g., improvement or degradation of data quality)
- Breakdown of data quality by rule or criterion
- Top data quality issues or errors
- Recommendations for improving data quality

#### 5. Conclusion
Summarize the key findings of the data quality assessment and outline any actions to be taken to address data quality issues identified.

#### 6. Appendices
Include any additional documentation or references related to the data quality assessment framework.

### Summary
A data quality assessment framework document provides a structured approach to evaluating and improving the quality of data within an organization. By defining rules, documenting assessment results, and presenting findings through a dashboard, stakeholders can gain valuable insights into data quality and take proactive measures to address any issues identified.
